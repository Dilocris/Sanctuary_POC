# Project Handoff - Agent Swap Complete

## Date: 2026-02-03
## Status: Phase 3 Logic Implemented + Phase 4 UI/Feedback Polish In Progress

### Procedure Update (Parser Safety)
- After **any** `.gd` edit, run:
  - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev/check_gdscript_sanity.ps1`
- This check blocks handoff if it finds merge markers or split GDScript keywords (example: `i  f`) that cause class parse failures.
- If Godot CLI is available locally, also run a headless parse/open to confirm script load before commit.

### 1. Completed Features
- **Ludwig Von Tannhauser**:
  - `Guard Stance` (Toggle, Status Logic)
  - Maneuvers: `Lunging Attack`, `Precision Strike`, `Shield Bash`, `Rally`.
  - Superiority Dice resource management.
- **Ninos the Bard**:
  - Actions: `Vicious Mockery` (Deals dmg + ATK_DOWN), `Healing Word`, `Bless`.
  - Inspiration: `Inspire Attack` logic placeholder.
- **Catraca the Sorcerer**:
  - Actions: `Fire Bolt`, `Fireball` (AoE logic), `Mage Armor`.
  - Metamagic: Placeholder structure ready.
- **Battle Harness (`battle_scene.tscn`)**:
  - Full party loop (Kairus, Ludwig, Ninos, Catraca) vs Marcus Gelt.
  - Active Status Effects display UI.
  - Interactive loop demonstrating all new abilities.
- **Phase 4 UI Scaffolding**:
  - `BattleMenu` + `TargetCursor` scenes/scripts added.
  - `battle_scene.gd` now drives player turns via menu/target selection.
  - Battle log panel (top-left) shows recent messages + effect results with turn separators.
  - Limit gauge bar displayed per character in party panel.
- **Feedback/Polish Pass**:
  - Boss HP bar now uses a thicker pill bar with color thresholds.
  - Active turn highlighting in party panel + name-under-sprite labels.
  - Added idle sway, action whip, and hit shake to sprites.
  - Damage numbers are larger, orange, and stagger for multi-hit.
  - Non-active idle is now stepped (2 keyframes, low amplitude) with per-actor phase offsets.
  - Party panel HP uses pill bars with bold current HP and smaller max HP.
  - Limit Break uses a progress bar (grey until 100%, blue at full) with aligned % text.
  - Limit Breaks are now wired for all four heroes with a cinematic overlay text per activation.
  - Limit Gauge now accrues on damage dealt and damage taken (DOT included, lower gain for DOT).
  - Enemy telegraph shows a 2s intent callout using player-facing action names.
  - Menu cursor now uses a small diamond marker; description panel shifted to avoid overlap.
  - Catraca’s Attack now uses Fire Bolt; Fire Bolt removed from Magic submenu.
  - ATK_DOWN now scales damage using the status value (default 25%).
