# Sanctuary POC Documentation Hub

Use this file as the single starting point for both human and agent work.

## Why this structure exists
- Minimize unnecessary re-reading.
- Keep active docs short and actionable.
- Keep historical context available without polluting current context.

## Read Paths

### Fast Path (2-5 minutes)
1. `docs/STATUS.md`
2. `docs/ROADMAP.md`
3. `docs/AGENT_SWAP.md` (latest section)

### Standard Path (feature implementation)
1. Fast Path
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. Relevant file from `docs/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`

### Deep Path (design/reconciliation)
1. Standard Path
2. `docs/battle_system_gdd.md` (selected sections only)
3. Archived logs only if timeline/history is required

## Active Docs (keep short, update frequently)
- `docs/STATUS.md`: Current project snapshot and immediate priorities.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Actionable backlog and acceptance criteria.
- `docs/AGENT_SWAP.md`: Rolling short work log + handoff.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Current vs target architecture for scale-up.
- `docs/PROGRAM_PLAN.md`: Prototype-to-RPG expansion phases.
- `docs/DOCS_MAINTENANCE.md`: Rules for doc hygiene and archival.
- `docs/ANIMATION_SETUP.md`: Battle animation authoring contract.
- `docs/POLISH_TODO.md`: Remaining polish implementation tasks.

## Reference Docs (read only when needed)
See `docs/REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.

## Archived Docs
- `docs/archive/logs/`: Full historical session logs.
- `docs/archive/legacy/`: Superseded or duplicate docs retained for traceability.

## Single Source Rules
- Current status: `docs/STATUS.md`.
- Pending execution work: `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Recent implementation timeline: `docs/AGENT_SWAP.md`.
- Historical/retired context: `docs/archive/`.
